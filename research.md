  <div class="project-content">
    <h4>Developing Generalizable Weed Detection Methods</h4>
    <p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Harshavardhan Subramanian</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Current weed detection systems lack generalizability across different crops, growing conditions, and weed species, limiting their practical application in precision agriculture.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We leverage large pre-trained foundation models and transfer learning techniques to develop robust weed detection methods that can adapt to diverse agricultural environments with minimal training data.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Our methods enable targeted herbicide application, reducing chemical usage and environmental impact while improving crop yields and farm sustainability.</p>

  <div class="project-content">
    <h4>CrossModal Behavior Analysis for Livestock</h4>
    <p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Audio and video signals from farm environments are often noisy and difficult to interpret, making automated animal behavior monitoring challenging.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We develop crossmodal learning systems that combine multiple sensor modalities (audio, video, environmental sensors) and use uncertainty analysis to prioritize the cleaner signal for reliable behavior assessment.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Early detection of animal health issues, improved welfare monitoring, and reduced manual inspection workload for farmers, leading to healthier livestock and more efficient farm management.</p>

  <div class="project-content">
    <h4>AI-Enhanced Plant Breeding</h4>
    <p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Dr. Georg Back</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Understanding the complex relationship between genetic information and observable plant characteristics remains a bottleneck in accelerating plant breeding programs.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We leverage deep learning approaches to decode genotype-phenotype relationships, enabling prediction of plant traits from genetic data and accelerating the selection of superior varieties.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Faster development of crop varieties with improved yield, disease resistance, and climate adaptability, contributing to global food security.</p>

  <div class="project-content">
    <h4>AI-Powered Early Warning System for Downy Mildew in Hop Production</h4>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Current downy mildew warning systems in hop production rely on outdated manual counting methods and lack regional specificity, leading to delayed responses and inefficient fungicide application.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We leverage AI and smart traps (Burkhard-Sporenfalle) to automate the daily counting process of zoosporangia and develop a regionalized early warning system that provides timely, location-specific risk assessments.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduced crop losses, optimized fungicide usage, lower production costs, and minimized environmental impact in hop farming.</p>

### smartBattery: Energy Storage Optimization

<div class="research-project image-left">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/research/sb.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="smartBattery Project" class="project-image">
  <div class="project-content">
    <h4>Machine Learning for Smart Grid Integration</h4>
    <p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Marco Obermeier</p>
    <p><strong>Project Duration:</strong> October 2025 - September 2028</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The surge in large-scale battery storage (500+ GW grid connection requests in Germany as of 08/2025) challenges power grids with limited capacities, unclear optimal sites due to technical, economic, and regulatory factors, and the need for flexible grid agreements under high investment uncertainty.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We develop the "smartBattery Toolbox" - data-driven ML toolbox containing energy time series analysis, forecasting, storage optimization across markets, and site evaluation considering grid constraints and economic factors.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Accelerated battery rollout, reduced grid congestion, lower energy costs through optimal dispatch, and enhanced renewable energy integration.</p>

### smartReForest: Resilient Reforestation

<div class="research-project image-right">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/research/sr.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="smartReForest Project" class="project-image">
  <div class="project-content">
    <h4>Smart Solutions for Climate-Resilient Forests</h4>
    <p><strong>Researcher:</strong> Leonie Hahn</p>
    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Climate change threatens forest ecosystems and the essential services they provide. Traditional reforestation approaches often fail to account for future climate conditions and species adaptability.</p>
    <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We develop AI-driven decision support systems that combine climate projections, species modeling, and ecological data to optimize reforestation strategies for long-term forest resilience and ecosystem service provision.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Climate-adapted forests that maintain biodiversity, carbon sequestration, water regulation, and other critical ecosystem services for future generations.</p>
