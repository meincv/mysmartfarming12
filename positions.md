## 🎓 Master's Thesis – Open Topics

We offer research-oriented Master’s thesis projects for motivated students interested in **computer vision, deep learning, and precision livestock farming**.

---

### 🐄 Topic 1: Soft-Biometric Recognition for Cattle Using Deep Learning

**Offered by:**  
Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi  

**Supervisors:**  
Prof. Dr. Florian Haselbeck  
Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi  

**Description:**  
This project focuses on developing an automated system to recognize multiple **physical and behavioral attributes** of cattle from images. Using deep learning, the system aims to predict traits such as:

- Age  
- Body condition  
- Coat color  
- Posture  

The research addresses challenges including **fine-grained visual discrimination**, **robustness to lighting and occlusions**, and **multi-attribute modeling**.  
The outcome contributes to **precision livestock farming** by enabling scalable and accurate cattle characterization.

### 🐄 Topic 2: Multi-View Cattle Re-Identification Using Deep Learning

**Offered by:**  
Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi  

**Supervisors:**  
Prof. Dr. Florian Haselbeck  
Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi  

**Description:**  
This topic investigates **non-invasive cattle re-identification** across multiple camera views in barn environments. The goal is to match individual animals across:

- Frontal views  
- Lateral views  
- Elevated views  

The project explores **deep feature extraction**, **metric learning**, and compares **CNN- and Transformer-based backbones**.  
This work supports automated, markerless animal monitoring in precision livestock farming.

### 🐄 Topic 3: Long-Term Cattle Re-Identification Across Temporal Appearance Changes

**Offered by:**  
Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi  

**Supervisors:**  
Prof. Dr. Florian Haselbeck  
Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi  

**Description:**  
This project addresses the challenge of maintaining **consistent cattle identities over long periods**, despite:

- Growth  
- Seasonal coat changes  
- Body condition variations  

The objective is to develop **temporal-aware deep learning models** that can recognize the same animal over months.  
This research is essential for **long-term livestock monitoring** and reliable markerless identification systems.
