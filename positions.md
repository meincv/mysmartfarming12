### Master's Thesis Open Topics

We offer thesis projects for our students. 

**Available Topics:**
Topic 1: Softbiometric Recognition for Cattle Using Deep Learning
Offered by: Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi
Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Florian Haselbeck and Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi
This topic focuses on developing an automated system to recognize multiple physical and behavioral attributes of cattle from images. By leveraging deep learning, the system aims to predict traits such as age, body condition, coat color, and posture, enabling more efficient herd management, health monitoring, and breeding decisions. The work addresses challenges in fine-grained visual discrimination, robustness to lighting and occlusions, and multi-attribute modeling, contributing to precision livestock farming through accurate and scalable cattle characterization. For more details contact Ehsan Yaghoubi.

Topic 2: Multi-View Cattle Re-Identification Using Deep Learning
Offered by: Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi
Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Florian Haselbeck and Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi
This topic investigates the non-invasive identification of individual cattle across different camera angles within a barn setting. Using deep learning-based feature extraction and metric learning, the system aims to match cattle identities across frontal, lateral, and elevated views. The research explores the challenges of viewpoint variation, comparing CNN and Transformer backbones, and contributes to precision livestock farming by enabling continuous, automated monitoring of individual animals without relying on physical markers. For more details contact Ehsan Yaghoubi.

Topic 3: Long-Term Cattle Re-Identification Across Temporal Appearance Changes
Offered by: Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi
Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Florian Haselbeck and Dr. Ehsan Yaghoubi
This topic addresses the challenge of maintaining individual cattle identities over extended periods despite growth, seasonal coat changes, and variations in body condition. The goal is to develop temporal-aware deep learning models capable of recognizing the same animal across multiple months. By studying long-term appearance dynamics and designing robust embeddings, this research supports continuous livestock monitoring and contributes to precision farming practices that require reliable, markerless identification over time.
