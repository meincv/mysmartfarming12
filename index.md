Welcome to the smAIL-WS Research Group.
We explore the frontiers of science and technology at the intersection of agriculture, artificial intelligence, and data science. Our research focuses on developing AI-driven solutions for smart and sustainable farming, including weed detection, crop monitoring, and the assessment of animal behavior and health. In addition, we investigate genotype–phenotype relationships to enable data-informed breeding strategies and to enhance the resilience of crops and livestock.
