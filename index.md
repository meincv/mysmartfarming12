Welcome to the **Smart Farming Research Group** at [Hochschule Weihenstephan-Triesdorf](https://www.hswt.de/), Campus Weihenstephan (near Munich, Bavaria). Our interdisciplinary team investigates the frontiers of **Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and digital technologies** to address global challenges in agriculture.

## Our Mission

Agriculture faces unprecedented challenges: demanding production conditions, high workload, global competitive pressure, and increasing social and political expectations. Our research group develops innovative AI-powered solutions to make farming more sustainable, efficient, and resilient.

## Research Focus

We conduct **applied research leveraging Artificial Intelligence** to:

- Develop novel methods for sustainable agriculture
- Address real-world farming challenges through digitalization
- Bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and agricultural practice
- Support the transition to climate-resilient and environmentally friendly farming systems

## Key Research Areas

Our work spans multiple domains including weed detection, animal monitoring, plant disease prevention, precision forestry, renewable energy integration, and plant breeding optimization. Each project combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with deep domain expertise in agriculture and environmental sciences.

## Location

We are based at **Campus Weihenstephan**, part of Hochschule Weihenstephan-Triesdorf, located in Freising near Munich, Bavaria, Germany. Our campus provides an ideal environment for agricultural research with direct access to experimental fields, farms, and forestry areas.

## Collaboration & Education

Beyond research, we are committed to training the next generation of agricultural technology experts through our teaching programs, including the Master's programme in Digital Farming. We actively collaborate with industry partners, farmers, and research institutions to ensure our innovations have real-world impact.
